    <string name="news_sample">American Sydney McLaughlin has shattered her own 400m hurdles world record at the world athletics championships, leaving fans lost for words.
McLaughlin, the reigning Olympic champion, was the red-hot favourite and absolutely smashed her own world record by nearly a second in the final on Saturday in Eugene, Oregon.
The 22-year-old was streaks ahead of the field well before the turn and left her world-class rivals in her wake to cross the line in 50.68sec.
The incredible time chopped nearly a full second off her previous mark of 51.41, set at last yearâ€™s Tokyo Olympics.</string>
